* B:  Incidence matrix 

* G:  line matrix, has same eigenvalues as A
     G = B'B with L = (1/2) BB'

* spectrum of A is the same as spectrum of G

* spectrum of P = D_A^-1 A is the same as spectrum D_G^-1 D

* use longtable for all tables, so as to include the tables in their
  respective subsection. 
* glossary:  link to the relevant sections 
* definition of the weight function for a node pair:  add a case for DYNAMIC 
* include a table of content
